This Python script implements a number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a predefined range.
The program provides feedback for each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues iteratively until the correct number is guessed.
Designed for beginners, this script offers a practical exercise in using loops, conditional statements, and handling user input in Python, enhancing understanding of basic programming concepts and logical flow control.
